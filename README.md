<div id="body">
  <ul>
    <li> 🚩 I'm about to graduate in a week. WOOOHOOOO </li>
    <li>🐱 I have a cat, his name is Silly cause he is silly. </li>
    <li> I love paddle boards but there's not emoji for it. SAD </li>
    <li>✈️ I hope COVID ends soon so I can visit home.</li>
    <li>♟️ I tried to learn chess, but it is very hard to track every motion of each piece so I gave up. </li>
    <li>🧩 Since it was hard to learn chess, I found that doing puzzle is more relaxing. </li>
  </ul>
